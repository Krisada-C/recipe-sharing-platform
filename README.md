Project Description: 
A Recipe Sharing Web Application provides a platform where cooking enthusiasts can share their favorite recipes, discover new dishes, and engage with others in a community setting. Key features include user authentication for secure account management, recipe management for adding, editing, and deleting recipes, and a commenting system that allows users to interact by sharing feedback and tips similar to how social media like Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, etc allows users to interact between users but with much simpler and less complicated features, an application with search and filter options, users can easily find recipes by keywords, ingredients, or categories. Additionally, user profile management enables personalization and tracking of contributions meaning users can view and manage their posts, comments, and other interactions they had. This feature helps users keep track of their activity and contributions to the community.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
